# IPFS Team Roles

The individual contributors to the IPFS Project and Org often find themselves wearing many hats while performing they day to day tasks or on the projects they are focused on. We enable this by design to make the IPFS Org very permeable and empower each team to find its perfect balance for the challenges they are facing.

This doc presents the definition of only two roles, these are a) the ones we identified as necessary to have a well functioning Working Group and b) the ones that raise more questions. There are many other roles (project manager, designer, UX researcher, developer, systems engineer, etc), that we are not defining in this doc (yet).

## IPFS Working Groups specific roles

There are mainly two that are unique to our [Team Structures](TEAM_STRUCTURES.md). The responsibilities within these roles can be shared between multiple individuals, however, they must be owned by a single person that takes the responsibility to ensure the work is happening.

### Captain

The Working Group Captain is a champion for the Product and/or Focus Area. It takes the lead on writting or guiding the conversation specs, documentation and other artifacts to support the team. The Captain is also the gatekeeper of the Working Group Roadmap and accumlator of the Working Group Knowledge, guiding the group to made good decisions.

### Technical Manager

The Technical Manager (sometimes referenced as Project Manager, Technical Project Manager and cat herder) is a team enabler. It ownes the Quarterly Planning process including OKRs and Retrospectives. It ensures that the coordination strategy the WG selected is well executed (weekly syncs, taking notes, communicating needs to other WGs).

The Technical Manager should also have a role on contributing to the projects the Working Group is tackling and have an understanding of the technical challenges and needs from the team.

It happens that some working groups are ok with having the same person playing the Captain + Technical Manager role together, it works for when the Working Group is nascent or the team is small.
