# IPFS - Project Management

This is a repository for general ipfs project management.

## Sprints

IPFS is adopting a sprint cycle. Each sprint is a manageable amount of work per person. We will seldom add or drop work mid-sprint. This means incoming PRs or new issues may not be addressed until a sprint. We will try to make sure things don't get backlogged for long periods of time. 

If you'd like to join a sprint, let @jbenet know how much time + and what you'd like to take on. It is recommended to take things off the backlog, and check in with the team at the daily "sprint checkin".

- Sprint Duarion: 1 week.
- Sprint Discuss: Mondays at `19:00-20:00 UTC` via +hangout (link posted on IRC)
- Sprint Checkin: Daily at `19:00-19:05 UTC` on `#ipfs` IRC

There will be issues representing sprints here, as described in https://www.zenhub.io/blog/how-the-zenhub-team-uses-zenhub-boards-on-github/#keepingarecordofsprints
