# IPFS - Project Management

This is a repository for general ipfs project management.

#### Please don't open issues here unless you know what you're doing.

## Sprints

IPFS is adopting a sprint cycle. Each sprint gives us a manageable amount of work per person, to be completed within the cycle. It adds a heartbeat to our development. We will seldom add or drop work mid-sprint, though exceptions may emerge. This means incoming PRs or new issues may not be addressed until the next sprint. We will try to make sure things don't get backlogged for long periods of time. 

If you'd like to join a sprint, let `@jbenet` know how much time + and what you'd like to take on. It is recommended to take things off the backlog, and check in with the team at the daily "sprint checkin".

- Sprint Duration: 1 week
- Sprint Discuss: Mondays at `19:00-20:00 UTC` via +hangout (link posted on IRC)
- Sprint Checkin: Daily at `19:00-19:05 UTC` on `#ipfs` IRC

Each sprint will be synthesized into an issue in this repo, as described in https://www.zenhub.io/blog/how-the-zenhub-team-uses-zenhub-boards-on-github/#keepingarecordofsprints


### Sprint Checkin (Sync)

The sprint checkin is a quick sync-up (on IRC) to fine tune the sprint. It helps the sprint master know what's progressing, what's blocking people, and what adjustments need to be made. This sync is critical to ensure the success of the sprint as a whole. If you cannot make it to a print checkin, leave your update + comments on the sprint's issue before the sync happens.

Each person must answer (kanban style):

- What obstacles are impeding my progress?
- (looking at the sprint assignments) What has progressed?
