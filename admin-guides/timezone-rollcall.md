### Current Team
This covers the time zones that we currently get participants from.

> - UTC +2 Eastern Europe 
- UTC +1 Central Europe 
- UTC
- UTC -5 US Eastern timezone
- UTC -6 US Central timezone
- UTC -7 US Mountain timezone
- UTC -8 US Pacific timezone  
- ... and anyone who was missed or who dialed in during roll call

 
### More Time Zones

**If you need to include people who are from other spots in the world, add their time zones to the list on the fly as necessary.**  If we regularly get participants from a particular time zone, submit a PR adding it to the default script. 

**If you need to cover the whole world**, simply count from UTC -11 up to UTC +11. When you're done, check for  any people who were missed or who dialed in during roll call.
