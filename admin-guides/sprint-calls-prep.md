# Prep for Weekly Calls

## Who is Responsible

- Host stays the same for each month.
- Last week of each month, identify a host for the following month.
- If the host can't make it some week, they are responsible for delegating to someone and make sure they have permissions at least a day ahead.

## Host Responsibilities

On Wednesday of the preceding week:
- Make sure that [node-github-issue-bot](https://github.com/ipfs/node-github-issue-bot) has created the next sprint issue. It should use templates from [here](https://github.com/ipfs/node-github-issue-bot/tree/master/templates). If it breaks, look at [the README in ipfs/infrastructure](https://github.com/ipfs/infrastructure/tree/master/sprintbot).
- Manually fill out the Notes link with [the templates](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/tree/master/templates). To not do this manually, follow [this issue](https://github.com/ipfs/node-github-issue-bot/issues/8).

#### Before the Call
1. Make sure agenda is posted beforehand in github (Under current format, ideally a day or more so people can add items before the meeting. Also consider proposed changes in #636.)
1. Post a notice just prior to and at meeting time on IRC, Twitter, & relevant channels

#### During the Call
1. Be there at the start time promptly. You donâ€™t need to moderate, but you have all the rights so you must be there to grant them.
1. Identify a notetaker. Bot is down as of June 2018, but host can call for volunteers and nudge people who haven't taken notes recently.
1. Facilitate the call, keeping an eye on time & looking out for raised hands.

#### After the Call

1. Close the previous week's sprint issue.
1. Uploading the recording to YouTube.
1. Make sure that the Notetaker PRed the notes to `ipfs/pm/meeting_notes`.
