**Notes**



*   Starts with a portal permaweb.io
*   Take back control from the internet giants
*   “App Store”
*   Tutorials, blog posts, meetups, apps
*   Permaweb Writer
*   Close to Textile team
*   Discord and Matrix chat bridges
*   Discord doesn’t have a native IRC chat bridge, so Permaweb is maintaining that
*   The permaweb is ideal for free speech
*   Too difficult to write text and put it on IPFS
*   Permaweb Writer has things you’d find on Medium, eg. Emojis
*   Since IPFS Camp… New concept
    *   Teams
    *   Teams want a Dropbox Paper replacement for IPFS
    *   Between Slack and Gmail
    *   Reactions: Approve, Disagree, Needs thinking
    *   Lots of keyboard shortcuts, wysiwyg
    *   Notes, To-do, Pastebin, Blog, CMS, Collaboration…
    *   Try to do the opposite of Notion … able to publish to your website
*   github.com/permaweb and permaweb.io
*   Q: How is Textile stack? A: Thank god for Textile! Makes it super easy for product people to work with.
