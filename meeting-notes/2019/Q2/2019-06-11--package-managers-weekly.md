### Notes

- [Bernhard](https://github.com/bmwiedemann) is running repositories for OpenSuse
  - Having problems with IPFS
  - fetches latest updates adding 2-4GB per day
  - ipfs object add patch
  - keeping a rolling history of snapshots in CIDS
  - attempting to publish IPNS updates but is slow
  - ipfs process is growing and growing, reaching 8000 connections (ipfs bitswap)
  - currently using go-ipfs 0.4.20
  - molly recommeneded upgrading to 0.4.21
  - IPNS team is working to improve speed
  - reducing the number of peers you need confirmation for may speed things up
    - ipfs name resolve â€”helpâ€©--dhtrc, --dht-record-count uint   - Number of records to request for DHT resolution.â€¨  --dhtt,  --dht-timeout      string - Max time to collect values during DHT resolution eg "30s". Pass 0 for no timeout.
  - likes deduplication between snapshots
  - using it for reproducabile builds for historical backups
  - was using a squid server but it was downloading duplicates, couldn't rely on a single mirror to be reliable
  - current
  - found ipfs.io gateway more reliable than cloudflare at the moment
  - his server is pushing a lot of bandwidth recently (128GB)
  - gateway is serving 10-20TB/day
  - histories and snapsots at http://opensuse.zq1.de/ (listing 4.2TB of data)
  - https://lizards.opensuse.org/2019/04/03/experimental-opensuse-mirror-via-ipfs/
  - go-ipfs doesn't having a restart/reload config command

- Jessica requests filtering https://hackmd.io/CsTxYif5Tk--svo2nKv0TA?both down to 20 problems and benefits today before getting them printed
- Alex needs a list of things to be downloaded and cached for IPFS camp
