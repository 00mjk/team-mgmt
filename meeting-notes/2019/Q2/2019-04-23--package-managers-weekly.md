### Notes

- distributed identity as related to package management: discussion
- molly is chatting with wasmer (sp?)
- can cdnjs integrate with IPFS to ensure you load it locally via ipfs if you already have it

3 types of identity
- personal identity
- 2fa, password logins
- derived identity (what your isp has collected about you)
  - debian (etc) package history graph with red/yellow/green for each node is similar
