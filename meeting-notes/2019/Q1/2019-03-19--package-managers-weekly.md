  - London meetup with @achingbrain, @olizilla and @alanshaw
  - wrote up package linked list thoughts: https://github.com/protocol/package-managers/issues/22
    - bake the CID to the previous release into the next release as a simpler mechanism to track versions / doesn't need an external indexing process.
  - Opened "blockers" pr to highlight problems preventing further adoption: https://github.com/protocol/package-managers/pull/21
    - we're hoping to remove items from the blockers list as fixes and features land in IPFS
  - made a docker image to automate testing of clojars mirroring: https://github.com/andrew/clojars-mirror-test
    -  it takes 24hrs to run some of these experiments
    - looking for somewhat smaller datasets to run experiments on that dont take longer to update than the time between mirror updates

### Notes

- thinking about ipfs-on-npm gui app idea - a small UI to visualise your npm stats and to encourage end users to keep a long running process that is re-sharing modules downloaded.

- ask: make a presentation for lisbon hack and plan, that we can share around. What really are package managers and what are the issues with using them with IPFS.

- we have 2 sessions for package-manager outcomes planning. They are FUN. and dig up lots of unverbalised assumptions.

- what is our mechanism for comparing merkle-tree layout ideas (in general, and specifically for package versioning.)

### Questions

- When public? :D
  - lets aim for when we ship the Q2 OKRs
  - can we open up sooner?
  - opening a repo doesn't make a thing publicised. Consider twitter / blog post / all our channels, to announce.
  - get alex on "The manifest" to reach more folks!
