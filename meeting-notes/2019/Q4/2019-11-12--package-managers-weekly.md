IPNS-over-PubSub

    - Removes internal bootstrapping in favor of pubsub discovery
    - Breaking API changes (shouldn't effect anything other than IPNS, API breakage has been advertised on discuss.libp2p.io for months)
  - [go-ipfs#6758](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6758) on going
    - Uses the new router and updated pubsub in IPFS
    - Having issues figuring out sharness tests

Testground
  - Getting started with IPNS tests, need backup from the testground team

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- Implemented [testground test plan](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/82) for multiple seed / leech scenario

#### UnixFS v1.5
@achingbrain

- Still discussing the spec.

#### Mount
@djdv

(No update - Prioritising home repairs)
(Will likely be discussing the mount implementation and 9P protocol at the package manager knowledge sharing meeting this Thursday)

#### IPFS Add Performance
@aschmahmann

Seems like there's consensus on supporting asynchronous datastores [go-datastore#137](https://github.com/ipfs/go-datastore/issues/137)

Plan is people will change their config files to use async writes in Badger if they really need performace.

Assembling list of places we use the datastore so we know where we actually need to call the `Sync` function we're proposing.
