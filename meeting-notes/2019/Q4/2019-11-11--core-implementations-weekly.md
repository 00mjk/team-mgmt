### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgraded Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs 0.40.0-rc.0 released just now!
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2558

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

* Testground Hack Week happened
* Can now run 100-200 libp2p nodes per AWS instance
* Have a bunch of new people contributing test cases
* TODO
  * Network tuning (NAT, latency, bandwidth, IP assignment, etc.)
    * Status: WIP (steb)
  * Mixed networks (go-ipfs + js-ipfs, versions, etc.)
    * Status: not started
  * One-click (one command) test runs on AWS
    * Status: WIP?
  * GitHub integration for starting/scheduling test runs.
    * Status: not started
  * Dashboard: UX for viewing test results.
    * Status: WIP (jim)
  * Improved libp2p tracing.
    * Status: raul?

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- Support base32 encoded CID in IPNS paths (in js-ipfs 0.40)
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2566

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending async/await

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

IPNS-over-PubSub
  - [go-libp2p-pubsub-router#37](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/37) ready for review
    - Removes internal bootstrapping in favor of pubsub discovery
    - Breaking API changes (shouldn't effect anything other than IPNS, API breakage has been advertised on discuss.libp2p.io for months)
  - [go-ipfs#6758](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6758) on going
    - Uses the new router and updated pubsub in IPFS

Testground
  - Getting started with IPNS tests, need backup from the testground team

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

Seems like there's consensus on supporting asynchronous datastores [go-datastore#137](https://github.com/ipfs/go-datastore/issues/137)

@raulk indicated that there are areas in the codebase that probably need synchronous datastores, need to get a survey of what could actually break if we just switched to asynchronous datastores
  - Blocked by people being busy with testground
  - create "audit all uses of datastore" issue to specify whether need to be sync or async
  
Since upgrading to asynchronous datastores is a config file change, we should consider what the upgrade path for users using Badger will look like. This might be blocked on making our config file handling better.
  - badger is still esperimental - folks will change if they need to

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- Repo migration tool is merged and in 0.40
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2527
- @alanshaw reviewing repo multihash keys migration atm

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

Implemented [testground plan](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/82) for Bitswap (multiple seeds / leeches)

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p ([trello board](https://trello.com/b/ibz3Ub0a/js-libp2p-async-refactor))
  - Identify refactor is done, this also adds support for IdentifyPush to js-libp2p [js-libp2p#473](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/473)
  - Circuit Relay refactor is in progress, should be finished this week.
  - Initial [PeerStore refactor](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/470) and [Registrar](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/471) additions have been added.
    - This should unblock pubsub
  - Pubsub, Floodsub and Gossipsub should get finished this week
  - Secio refactor is mostly finished, Jacob needs to review, and there are a couple of small blockers
    - @mkg20001's local benchmarks showed a pretty [significant improvement](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-secio/issues/96#issuecomment-551178753) in performance
    
- js-ipfs-http-api
    - @alanshaw Converted bitswap to async/await [ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client#1149](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client/pull/1149)

- interop
    - @pedromiguelss completed https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/87
    - Next up: https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/pull/547

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

@adin:
- Any interest in porting pubsub router changes to js-libp2p?

@olizilla: bifrost things
- the gateway nodes started crashing over the weekend with `panic: concurrent write to websocket connection` on every node, every hour or so. Nothing changed from the infra side of things.
  - https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/issues/372
    - Seems like https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6197#issuecomment-552460523 
  - we've updated the nodes to a more recent commit on the go-ipfs/feat/stablize-dht branch which seems to not be suffering the same issue.
  

- 4 new boostrap nodes are provisioned and monitored and published under /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io
