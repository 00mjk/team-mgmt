*   [ProtoSchool tutorial on IPFS Regular Files API](https://proto.school/#/regular-files-api)
    *   Gil Domingues’ new tutorial on the Regular Files API (as opposed to the Mutable File System)
        *   Commands like add and get
        *   Please poke around and [play with it](https://proto.school/#/regular-files-api)! You need JavaScript skills (because coding challenges) but nothing else -- not even IPFS knowledge.
*   ProtoSchool now includes a link to the [CID Inspector](https://cid.ipfs.io/) whenever there’s a CID in a tutorial’s content! Thanks to Alan for building such an awesome tool.
*   [New guidance for designing effective ProtoSchool tutorials](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/blob/code/DESIGNING_TUTORIALS.md)
    *   Want to build a tutorial? We want to make it as easy as possible for you
    *   We previously had instructions on developing tutorials, but we weren’t telling people how to design effective content that fits the platform well -  what the guiding principles were, what content ProtoSchool could handle, etc etc etc 
    *   Plus, tips about how to create lessons - not accidentally teaching JS when you want to teach IPFS, what a manageable chunk of a section of a tutorial is, etc
    *   The existing guidance on how to build a ProtoSchool tutorial, from a development perspective, has been pulled out of the main readme and now lives [here](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/blob/code/DEVELOPING_TUTORIALS.md).
*   [IPFS Docs Beta](https://docs-beta.ipfs.io/) sneak peek
    *   Getting close to shipping a new beta version of an improved IPFS docs site! Check the link for a sneak peek. Ideally launch will be EOY.
    *   You can check the overall progress of the beta as well as all other docs attention items in our OKRs - they’re in the [readme](https://github.com/ipfs/docs) for our repo
    *   Docs also start on the front of the main IPFS website! So we improved guidance on the [front of ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io/#install ) to show people the different flavors of IPFS they may want to install based on what they actually want to do with IPFS
    *   What’s good about the new IPFS docs beta?
        *   Search!
        *   Better overall navigation
        *   Eliminating links to random GitHub repos without a lot of guidance
        *   “Is this helpful” feedback mechanism
        *   Just a much nicer UI in general
    *   Be a beta tester for us! Join in the fun by filling out this (super quick) form, so we can contact you: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LVaD1B2uyW6Ff0jfU_iQ5mCeyQcHfyQO6BDD99XAgK0/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LVaD1B2uyW6Ff0jfU_iQ5mCeyQcHfyQO6BDD99XAgK0/edit)
