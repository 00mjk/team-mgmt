### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- js-ipfs is re-licensed MIT+Apache
  - Please add your sign-off https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2624

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- js-libp2p-kad-dht [silently drops messages](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/154) that are too long. Should it return errors to the remote client instead?

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
