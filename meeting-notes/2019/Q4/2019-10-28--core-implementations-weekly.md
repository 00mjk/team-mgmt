## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgraded Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- js-ipfs 0.39 released ü•≥
    - https://blog.ipfs.io/071-js-ipfs-0-39/
    - Kudos @achingbrain \o/
- js-ipfs 0.40 release issue created
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2558

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- Dirk jumping in as "first customer" to start testing bitswap improvements more granularly
- Jim working on Ansible scripting
- David working on planning
- In-person hack week next week
- Roadmap: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/75

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- [cid.ipfs.io](https://cid.ipfs.io): [fix: add support for libp2p-key multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/cid-utils-website/pull/14)
  - demo: https://cid.ipfs.io/#bafzbeigweq4zr4x4ky2dvv7nanbkw6egutvrrvzw6g3h2rftp7gidyhtt4
- [PeerID as CID](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/216) wip in JS land:
    - js-peer-id: [feat: support Peer ID represented as CID](https://github.com/libp2p/js-peer-id/pull/105)
    - js-multiaddr: [feat: multiaddr support Peer ID represented as CID](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiaddr/pull/102)
    - js-ipfs: (draft with discussion on next steps) [feat: js-ipfs support of CIDs in /ipns/ content paths](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2566)

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending async/await

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

- pubsub fixes getting ready to merge

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

- Lots of testing on ipfs add performance https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6523
     - TLDR: Add is really slow on Linux+ext4, fast on Windows+NTFS. Trying to figure out next steps. Is this a badger problem, ext4 problem, our problem?

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- new migrator tools for IPFS in browser
- next step, included in js-ipfs for repo migrations

#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

- Demo of basic write support: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX0vM0Ay9Z0

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- [PR](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/212) to improve Bitswap read performance in a gateway environment
- Ready to start code review for [Bitswap proof-of-concept](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189) changes
 - Start with the engine as that's the least likely to change
- Would like to get feedback for designing testground scenarios

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - internal crypto refactor should be done this week

- This week:
  - Alan: Hoping to write RFC for uniting files APIs for next week

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

@alanshaw ask: Please take a look at:
  - Maximising results from JS Core 2019 roadmap
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-core/issues/5
    - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/152863/67488305-7f574180-f667-11e9-8e0a-d5b72d967fd9.png" width="100%" />

  - @alanshaw? @achingbrain
  
### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

- Adin: Non-dialable nodes won't join the DHT - might break offline use cases
  - possible solution - offline/local DHT or pubsub
  - [go-ipfs#6737](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6737)
