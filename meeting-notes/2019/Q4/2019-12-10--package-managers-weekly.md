#### Badger By Default
@stebalien

Issue: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4279

- Blocked on badger 2.0
  - Don't want two migrations.

- Currently in final stages collating a forest of post-its into a coherent writeup
- In parallel downloading the tentative "mid-size corpus" locally for early experiments

#### Fix the DHT
@aschmahmann

- @raulk asked me to help look at https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/383
- looking into grafting some combination of https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/291 and https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/204 onto the stabilize branch 
- if it's not too bad do a multihash fix on the way https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/755#issuecomment-563935788
