### Initiatives

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien/@alanshaw

- Blog post shipped: https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-08-14-ipfs-release-process/

Next step: _This week_ @alanshaw will send a PR to update the JS IPFS release process to be more in line with the new Go IPFS release process.

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick/@stebalien/@alanshaw

* [IPFS Test Infrastructure Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jToUP0E0of0WSnLv7gdIEXXQgfscIaxq_aEbwCMPN28) needs feedbacks
* @bigs looking at nomad integration

Next step: _This week_ @alanshaw will review PR to benchmarks for go-ipfs update [#268](https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks/pull/268)

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@dirkmc/@alanshaw

Next step: _This week_ @alanshaw will merge GC PR [#2022](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2022)

#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

- [js-ipfs PR](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2298) is ready for review
  - js-ipfs PR depends on [ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core#503](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/pull/503)

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)

#### Repo Consolidation (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- [libp2p#400](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/400) was merged, all core modules are now in js-libp2p. Will do a patch release of this today/tomorrow, it's not a breaking change.

Next Step: archive the old repos and post deprecation notices. Also ensure npm has deprecation notices.

### Design Review Proposals

Design reviews from last week:
 
- Resolving /http multiaddr spec ([multiaddr/issues/63](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/issues/63))
  - Resolutions:
    - We need to handle paths for this use-case.
    - Punt (@stebalien still needs to post _his_ update on this in [multiaddr/issues/63](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/issues/63) and [post guidance in this PR](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6560#issuecomment-520671691))

### Blockers/Asks

None.

### Questions

- What is the current status of the gateways / DHT?
  - No change. Running a special branch on the gateway. Still experiencing issues on the gateway. We've been fixing connection manager bugs to help prevent disconnects. Working on bitswap performance. 

### Parking Lot


### Week Update (for async review)

@vasco-santos (not attending)
  - Done:
    - OOO
  - Blocked:
    - Need review on gossipsub integration for `js-ipfs`
      - [ipfs/js-ipfs#2298](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2298)
    - Need feedback on
      - [libp2p/interface-connection#29](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-connection/pull/29)
  - Next:
    - Async for:
      - `js-libp2p-webrtc-direct`
      - `js-libp2p-webrtc-star`
    - ethberlinzwei
    - Continue `interface-connection` PR work

@alanshaw
- Done:
    - PR for preloading on MFS commands that accept IPFS paths [#2355](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2355)
    - Completed implementation of `it-multistream-select` TODO: send PR to `js-multistream-select`
    - Submitted PR for fix bundle `globalObject` in web workers [#408](https://github.com/ipfs/aegir/pull/408)
    - Opened PR against [libp2p-mplex](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-mplex/pull/94) to integrate `it-mplex`
        - Addressed performance issues with existing `pull-mplex` benchmarks
        - Added "writev" support to [`it-pushable`](https://github.com/alanshaw/it-pushable/commit/003b1953dadf8811961b767fdfbdaf793ce0e4a8). TIL - [`writev`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/stream.html#stream_writable_writev_chunks_callback) is a method you can implement in a Node.js writable stream that allows you to accept writes of multiple chunks at a time. Accepting multiple messages at the mplex level can be faster than accepting them one at a time because there's no async boundary to cross.
    - Created [`stream-to-it`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-to-it) for converting Node.js streams to async iterables

@djdv
 - Done:
   - Still making progress on exposing IPFS over 9P (for mounting purposes)
     - Set up a Linux debug vm for testing the 9P kernel client
     - There seems to be some issue around the client's request to open the root directory: https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers/issues/74#issuecomment-522606699
 - Next:
   - continue debugging 9P ipfs-server <-> linux-client
   - Fix a test: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6489
   - There's a duplicate chocolatey(Windows package manager) package for IPFS. We maintain `ipfs` but `go-ipfs` also exists. I'm discussing this with the people there.
   - Likely talking about IPNS over DNS spec things

@Stebalien
 - Done:
   - Lots of reviews as usual.
   - CI improvements for go-ipfs.
     - Parallelized interop testing.
     - Shared CircelCI orb for go repos. Can test:
       - Benchmarks (comparisons)
       - Lint
       - Cross platform build.
       - Unit tests (in parallel!).
     - Migrated Bitswap + MFS to CircleCI
 - Next:
   - Hopefully push a bitswap patch to ensure it remains connected to useful peers.
   - Lots of work with dirk on bitswap design.
