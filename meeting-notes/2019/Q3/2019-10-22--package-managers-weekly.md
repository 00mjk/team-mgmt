## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann
- OOO

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Can we prioritize exploring a fix for https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/187 (Parallelize Reads) this week?
  - current work *does* parallelize reads
  - Can we try testing the new branch and see whether it can pull down from cluster faster?
  - Would need to deploy it on *cluster* actually - want to identify that this is an issue and that work in progress fixes that issue
  - @dirkmc will prioritize doing this on master in the next couple of days

#### UnixFS v1.5
@achingbrain
 - Waiting on writeup of metadata-in-directory proposal -> @stebalien needs to do this <-

#### Mount
@djdv
(copied from core impl notes)
 - Iterating on PR feedback - add experimental daemon plugin for 9P2000.L support (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6612)
 - trying to iron out ambiguities with plugins, config, etc. (we can do some things multiple ways, how SHOULD we do them? / what can users expect)
 - working on upstream deps (portability concerns in 9P lib, Golang's syscall/unix pkg)
 - writing and debugging tests
 - backload upstream changes instead of frontloading it
 - WIP of the writable version of it, some foundation stuff changed, but IPNS core API producing an error (may need Adin's help on that)

#### IPFS Add Performance
@aschmahmann
- OOO

#### IPFS Datastore Performance
@stebalien

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!
- @adin - help @djdv out with the IPNS issues he's experiencing
- @achingbrain --> @steb - write the unixfsv1.5 spec pls

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.
- momack2 - should I reach out to opensuse / guix
  - unixfsv1.5 - mode bits and modification times as metadata
  - once write functions, running a service on it should be the same as doing it on any other file system
  - it's a go! will aim to send tomorrow

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.
