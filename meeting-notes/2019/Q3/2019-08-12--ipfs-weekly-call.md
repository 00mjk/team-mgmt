*   Presenters: Zhanna Sharipova and Roman Khafizianov
*   The web is great, but monopolistic, and users can’t benefit (financially or otherwise) from a few companies hosting everything
*   Yet we are still using web 2.0 - because people use products, not protocols, and we need an interface to make the protocol into a real product
*   Anytype is a “browser with creator’s capabilities”
*   Users can browse content as well as create new web pages and services, using decentralized protocols without needing coding skills
*   “Unified User Interface”
    *   Based on simple blocks: text, file, image, video, person,  etc, and more complex blocks: a database of simple blocks
    *   Users can manage data with a built-in data wallet
    *   This block-based approach works because most applications today use similar design patterns: database views with content, menu bars, etc
    *   “Using these blocks even a child can create a sophisticated software product”
    *   But developers can find this useful, too: they can build their own blocks and integrations
    *   Each block has a unique hash, and users can connect anything to anything with content-addressable hash links
        *   Using p2p open-source protocols and frameworks as a backbone
        *   Currently an Electron cross-platform client (includes go-ipfs and Textile) but native clients to come in future
*   Use cases …
    *   Makers:
        *   A biohacker can create their perfect fitness dashboard
        *   A CRM or an ERP for a specific business, tailored for that business
        *   Bloggers/community leaders can create analogous services to Medium, Youtube, Spotify for their specific area of interest
    *   Millions of makers, key ones are domain experts in their fields, bloggers and community leaders. They will develop tools and services for other users
*   Vision of a new web:
    *   Each user has right to own their data and have private thoughts and communication
    *   Each user can exercise freedom of speech
    *   Clear and democratic rules to reward participants that create, promote, store, deliver content and services
*   Alpha product is ready
    *   Stage 1: desktop app for building web pages (Q3 2019)
    *   Stage 2: web services so non-tech users can create decentralized youtube, spotify, etc (2020)
    *   Stage 3: economy (2020/2021)
*   Alpha access may be available! Contact the Anytype folks on Twitter or fill form on our [site](https://www.anytype.io/).
*   Questions:
    *   Will I be able to publish web apps as well as desktop apps?
        *   It’s in progress
    *    Is there an early access program or something? 
        *   Alpha access may be available! Contact the Anytype folks on Twitter/[site](https://www.anytype.io/).
        *   Can I play with it?
        *   See above
    *    What would need to be added/fixed in IPFS to make anytype work better?
        *   Speed increases would be great
    *   How did you implement the "chat" program?
        *   Chat will be implemented in the next 6-8 months
