## Notes


### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- go-ipfs patch release did not ship, again.
- js-ipfs shipped! üö¢ üéâ
  - Additions to release process for this version:
    - Automated go/js interop testing
    - Automated testing of 3rd party repos
    - Release done from branch to allow development to continue on master
    - Includes shrinkwrap & yarn lockfiles to ensure users only get deps that have passed our CI

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- Demo by raul.
- Repo: https://github.com/ipfs/testground
- 10 initial tests: https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/33

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@achingbrain

- Shipped!

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- handling paths on subdomain gateways (like `dweb.link`) requires conversion at Nginx level until [go-ipfs/pull/6096](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096#issuecomment-511994883) lands
- RFC for Base32 in IPNS waiting for final :+1: [libp2p/specs/pull/209](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/209#issuecomment-536565826)
- docs.ipfs.io: first draft of an addressing guide: https://github.com/ipfs/docs/pull/298

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending the js-libp2p async refactor

#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

- @stebalien: Waiting on review from @stebalien
- @stebalien: IPNS over DNS
  - Needs a spec! @hugo?
  - @hugo - not done yet, aim to finish this week.

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

- No progress (assumed)

#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

- Read only IPFS support is coming along (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6612)
   - still some bugfixes needed (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6612#pullrequestreview-294370552)
- IPNS Write support is in progress (PR not up yet)
  - doesn't handle offset properly
  - republishing to the key doesn't work as expected


#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc / @stebalien

- No big updates
- Lots of time debugging connection management.
- Ask for libp2p: fix https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/79


#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@alanshaw / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos

- Libp2p: 18/30 Complete! (60%)
  - We've [started a guide](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/refactor/async-await/doc/STREAMING_ITERABLES.md) for iterable streams, it's a work in progress. We will be adding to this as we work through the refactor so that contributors and future users will have a resource for using them instead of pull streams.
  - Libp2p core refactor now [has a guide on our approach](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/266#issue-374385232) for iterating on the refactor to avoid a single, giant PR, and allowing multiple people to potential contribute more easily.
  - Modules finished:
    - libp2p-websockets [v0.13.0](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-websockets/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
    - libp2p-mdns [v0.13.0](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-mdns/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
    - interface-peer-discovery [v0.1.1](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-peer-discovery/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
    - interface-connection [v0.4.0](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-connection/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

- IPFS:
  - Merged [async await refactor of js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2390)
    - Upgrades libp2p to latest version
    - Upgrades ipld to latest version
    - Upgrades unixfs/mfs to latest version

- Multiformats: 100% Complete!
  - multistream-select [v0.15.0](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multistream-select/releases/tag/v0.15.0)

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- New:

- Old:
  - unixfsv1.5: @stebalien is still the DRI for writing this up.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.


### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.
 
 - @hugomrdias 
   - new browser datastore with a around 50% performance improvement
   - unixfs batching for around 50% performance improvement
   - still running the numbers to validate improvement
