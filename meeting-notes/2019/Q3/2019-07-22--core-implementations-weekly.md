## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process (go-ipfs)
@stebalien
- Stage 2 started - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6506
  - Early testers are testing in dev deployments
  - aiming to enter stage 3 next week

#### Upgrade Testing Process (go-ipfs)
@stebalien
- The testing team now has regular meetings (Wednesday, 8AM PST)
- Alan is reviving https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks
- Raul done some architecture design
- Jim has some ux mockups https://github.com/ipfs/canary-testing/issues/1#issuecomment-512631056

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@dirkmc

A first pass implementation is (even more) nearly ready to add garbage collection to js-ipfs https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2022.

- In the browser LRU eviction happens on origin basis
    - `ipfs.io/ipfs/Qm...` - lose everything
    - `Qm...ipfs.dweb.link` - more granular (still in origin group)
- There's a browser API for estimating storage remaining
- There's a browser API for your web app to request PERMENANT storage
- Current issue is potential out of memory issues

**Next step**: merge current PR and iterate to stream not buffer :)

#### Delegated Routing (js-ipfs)
@lidel

i.e. Get someone else to find your peers and your content

- Important for JS IPFS because, no DHT, same origin policy.
- nice stopgap for brave integration until we have content routing
- some local changes to PR to improve over swarm connecting constantly

2 Modules:
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing

**Next step**: @alanshaw still needs to look into:

- we need people to be able to expose commands on Gateway port via `Gateway.APICommands` which is not wired to anything in go-ipfs right now:
    - Context: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2155
    - Problem: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/371#pullrequestreview-255991314
- mitigate request flood producing pending requests in web browser context https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/issues/12
  - @lidel will PR some local patches that improve things significantly when running js-ipfs in Brave 

#### Gossipsub (js-ipfs)
@vasco-santos

JS implementation of gossipsub landing in the next release of `js-libp2p`
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/365
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-daemon/pull/19
- https://github.com/libp2p/interop/pull/17

Finishing up interop tests for go and js

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

Making it easier for [Base32-encoded CIDv1](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337) to be used in DNS as a  subdomain label:

```
https://<cidv1b32>.ipfs.example.com
https://<cidv1b32>.ipns.example.com
```

Shipped in userland:
 - https://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com/wiki/
 - https://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq.ipfs.dweb.link/wiki/

üõë Blocked:
- **tl;dr** we use Nginx for now, but want go-ipfs to support `Host` header with `{cidv1b32}.ip(f|n)s.*`
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6498
  - enables people to run subdomain gateways,
  removes dependency on Nginx hacks like [this one](https://github.com/ipfs/infra/issues/81#issuecomment-461045160)
  - unlocks unique Origins for localhost node and also [HTTP proxy](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2246)
- [Base32 in IPNS](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287) 
  - (we added `libp2p-key` multicodec to support CIDv1)
  - remaining steps:
   - IPNS paths: [wire up cid support instead of multihash](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287#issuecomment-498349216)
   - [how to handle CIDv1 with  `dag-pb` multicodec in `/ipns/`?](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287#issuecomment-492163929)
- cloudflare and others do this (at ngnix level)
- if we have support for subdomain gateway, and we run go-ipfs on local host, it would in theory provide origin isolation on local gateway (don't want to support both on same origin)
  - confirmed Origins are separate
- Encoding peer IDs as CIDs https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/pull/41
  - would like libp2p folks to look at this. would like to do it lower

#### Repo Consolidation (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

To help with Contributor Enablement we are merging related repositories together. Per [ipfs/js-ipfs#2222](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2222)
- [js libp2p core modules](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/384)
- [js libp2p interfaces](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/383)
  - Starting with interfaces as this will be the least disruptive change
  
in go - have *all* interfaces in core - naming around "core" is concerning - will just be named "js-libp2p", separate from js-libp2p-interfaces


#### IPNS
@aschmahmann
  - On-going:
    - Pushing through outstanding PubSub-over-IPNS PRs
      - Progress tracked at: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6447 (4 PRs currently)
 - Next:
   - Figure out what Package Manager team wants from IPNS in the near-medium term
   - IPNS features/improvments we neglected while IPNS was slow:
     - e.g. IPNS local pinning (e.g. https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4435)
     - Splitting IPNS from IPFS is some way so it can be used independently
   - Go-JS feature parity within IPNS

- next - features of IPNS we neglected because it was slow (ex local pinning)
