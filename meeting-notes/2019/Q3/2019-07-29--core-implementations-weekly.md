## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process (go-ipfs)
@stebalien

- Hitting stage 3 today
- No progress yet on a blog post

#### Upgrade Testing Process (go-ipfs)
@stebalien

- Nothing new (well, interop tests are now fixed modulo a bug in go-ipfs master)

#### Benchmarks (js-ipfs/go-ipfs)
@alanshaw

https://benchmarks.ipfs.team was resurrected

https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks/

Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG3bEH6Ijgo

Next steps: Get it useful for go-ipfs (@alanshaw)

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@dirkmc/@alanshaw

- PR is still outstanding, call for other humans to help pick this up if they're interested!

#### Delegated Routing (js-ipfs)

- @lidel, @alanshaw, @jacobheun:
  - [HTTP exhaustion solved by throttling concurrent delegate requests](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/issues/12)
    - fixes were backported to 0.2.x and released, can be used with older js-ipfs/js-libp2p:
        - [js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/pull/17](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/pull/17)
        - [js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/pull/13](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/pull/13)
 - @hugomrdias suggested another optimization: enable http/2 on preload/delegate nodes we provide: [ipfs/infra/issues/489](https://github.com/ipfs/infra/issues/489)


#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

Blocked on new release of `gossipsub`
- https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossipsub-js


- [libp2p/js-libp2p#365](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/365)
- [ipfs/js-ipfs#2298](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2298)

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- @stebalien - need feedback from the rest of the libp2p team on converting peerids to cids https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/pull/41

#### Repo Consolidation (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Started with port of libp2p-switch into the libp2p repo [js-libp2p#388](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/388)
  - This will pollute the libp2p commit history with switch commits but allows us to maintain contributor history. Left some thoughts there on mitigating this.
- Working on the combined interfaces repo https://github.com/jacobheun/js-interfaces. Trying to avoid antipattern imports for this. The interfaces include source code and test suites, looking to avoid unnecessary dependency bundling.

#### Distributed Signaling
@jacobheun

Currently webrtc signaling is done via a central signaling server, we would like to move to a more distributed approach [libp2p/spec#159](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/159). One such approach being discussed is to leverage a relay connection to perform an SDP exchange to upgrade to a direct webrtc connection.

Next steps:
- Create a proof of concept of the SDP Exchange over a circuit relay
- Flush out the signaling spec

#### IPNS
@aschmahmann

Still working on pubsub PRs (thanks @Stebalien for the helpful reviews ‚ù§Ô∏è).
  - go-libp2p-pubsub [PRs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6447)
    - will end up with PeerJoin/Leave notifications
    - will end up with Peer Discovery being called internally. Individual routers may/may not need to have built-in discovery parameters (like how many peers they want, or how often to check)
    - is considering both topic-wide configurations as well as publishing options
  - go-libp2p-pubsub-router
     - PR [go-libp2p-pubsub-router#33](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/33) basically done (although blocked by the pubsub PRs)
     - Was decided by libp2p team that this should have a custom protocol for asking for the latest state of a chanel (instead of utilizing pubsub)

When do we need this in JS?  
@hugomrdias: after gossipsub and ipns-over-dns lands maybe. (probably only next quarter) 

Moving namesys code into `go-namesys` unless there are any objections [go-ipfs#6537](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6537)

@hugomrdias @djdv IPNS over DNS Status
  - (Go) needs some cross-project clarity to move forward. Work is at https://github.com/ipfs/go-libp2p-dns-router
  - (JS) PRs still being cleaned up/finished. Epic issue [js-ipfs#2000](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2000)
  - Spec discussion for dealing multiple routers https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/198
  
Need cleanup/clarification of IPNS spec (https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/205)

#### Migration to multihash keys in datastore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-repo-migrations/pull/1

Currently CID is used as key in repo's datastore. This is an issue because of different base* encodings, which leads to data duplication.
It is currently hacked around, but better solution would be to use CID's multihash as a keys. 

Needed steps: create a migration to change datastore's keys; bump repo's version; update `js-ipfs-repo` to incorporate this change.

Any potential problems? What is `go-ipfs` stance on this? Should there be similar change there?
 - go-ipfs wants to do this - @stebalien
 - issue 1: `ipfs refs local` which is expected to return CIDs.
 - issue 2: provider records need to use raw multihashes.

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- @lidel: in an effort to remove confusion when native protocol handlers start to land in web browsers, proposed to use  `ipfs://{fqdn-with-dnslink}` as the URL for "ipfs websites" 
   (details/discussion: [ipfs/in-web-browsers/pull/150](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/pull/150))
   - Attendees (DRI: @stebalien):
     - @stebalien
     - @lidel
     - @aschmahmann
     - @djdv (maybe)
     - @alanshaw
- @stebalien: final decision on .eth TLD for DNSLINK. https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6448
   - Attendees (DRI: @stebalien):
     - @stebalien

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot

- hannah - question on multibase
  - weird 0 should be in the ipld-cbor spec
  - please explain WHY this is the case - Hannah make a PR to the cbor spec or bug warpfork to update this to be clearer
- windows testing
  - go-libp2p doesn't
  - js-libp2p now uses azure (for windows only)
  - resolution:
    - CircleCI (or double check - DRI: @stebalien)
    - Enable tests on windows.
    - Switch from travis.
