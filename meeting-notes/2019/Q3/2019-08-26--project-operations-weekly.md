-   🚢 🚢 🚢 Goal-based quiz is live on the front of[ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io/)! We’re using this to gather metrics to guide Q4 docs efforts (as well as just make the front page a bit better), those curious about test plan (passive metrics, UX testing, persona effort) can[see it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2TFeXLFW29a8HYwUq6K9-n8fDg2WhERRIi1CWHMC-8/edit)🚢 🚢 🚢
    -   Also go to the forums to learn about questions people are asking! (“something else” option in quiz will lead to specific forum question for this)
    -   Tested w/ 10 ppl (7 internal, 3 community)
