### Notes
- npm-on-ipfs - need infra support in order to make this experience better (not blocked on performance improvements)
  - need documentation on npm-on-ipfs's current state!
  - not clear whether we actually *intended* to launch this in
  - running npm-on-ipfs runs into locks if already watching js-ipfs because tries to spin up another IPFS node
    - need to avoid these usability issues

- Need to use sync meeting on Friday to finalized OKRs
