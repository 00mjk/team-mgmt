## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process (go-ipfs)

- Merged: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/releases.md
- Test Run: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6506
- working on 0.4.22-RC1 release
- draft blog post: https://github.com/ipfs/blog/pull/266 (steb will take a pass)

#### Upgrade Testing Process (go-ipfs)

Draft Plan: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyqyGUF-oe3x9ln88YonVeOMWWdknik74lVgL_3dBY8/edit#gid=0

- won't be releasing a new minor release until we have the launch-blocking testing infra to guarantee we aren't introducing regressions
- we need to upgrade our testing, blocking releases is the forcing function

Next step: Reach out to the DRIs.

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (JS)

Many PRs! A first pass implementation is nearly ready to add garbage collection to js-ipfs https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2022.

It has uncovered problems with pinning - internal blocks are provided to DHT, pin type filtering not work.

Perf is being investigated https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2198.

- previously there were issues with indexdb - does this work test for different browsers and their respect for different flags?
- david will shoot over any prior knowledge he can find (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria)
- go-ipfs just rewalks the datastore when reproviding, not sure how this actually works under the hood (ping steb for details)
  - We literally just walk the datastore, and provide everything by default. We _also_ have reprovider "strategies" (e.g., only reprovide pinned blocks).
  - We _do_ avoid providing on initial add.

Next step: fixing up PRs, reviewing PRs.

#### Delegated Routing (JS)

i.e. Get someone else to find your peers and retrieve your content

Important for IPFS in the browser because same origin policy.

Open HTTP API endpoints that allow another IPFS node to find peers/retrieve content on your Node's behalf.

2 Modules:
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing

üõë Blocked: 
 - we need people to be able to expose commands on Gateway port via `Gateway.APICommands` which is not wired to anything in go-ipfs right now:
  - Context: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2155
  - Problem: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/371#pullrequestreview-255991314
 - mitigate request flood producing pending requests in web browser context  https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/issues/12

- supports some brave usage with browser node in ipfs-companion
- both nodes swarm connect - ideally can also minimize DHT connections
- work required here is pretty small - would be a good place to onboard on go-ipfs as a js-ipfs integrator
  - actually, dropped because complex: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5565#issuecomment-455899527 - alan will take a look
- blocker is that people who would be interested in running delegated routing need to use our infra (and want them to be able to use their own!)
- there is also a neat hack to support "provide" by prefetching it to remote node https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-content-routing/blob/master/src/index.js#L85

#### Gossipsub (JS)

JS implementation of gossipsub landing in the next release of `js-libp2p`
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/365
- https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-daemon/pull/19
- https://github.com/libp2p/interop/pull/17

Will start working on getting `js-ipfs` ready to receive it
- want to make a RC next week to release js-ipfs, so you can choose which implementation you want to use 
- gossipsub is technically experimental, as is pubsub - floodsub is the default once you enable pubsub - but you can swap that
- if one person picks floodsub and another picks gossipsub, then you speak floodsub
- we should switch the default in go-ipfs (AI: stebalien)
- floodsub connects entirely to be connected to everyone - gossipsub does message propogation (want peer exchange)
  - confirmed: gossipsub does not do peer exchange. IMO, it should. - @stebalien

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)

Making it easier for [Base32-encoded CIDv1](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337) to be used in DNS as a  subdomain label:

```
https://<cidv1b32>.ipfs.example.com
https://<cidv1b32>.ipns.example.com
```

Shipped in userland:
 - https://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com/wiki/
 - https://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq.ipfs.dweb.link/wiki/

üõë Blocked:
- **tl;dr** we use Nginx for now, but want go-ipfs to support `Host` header with `{cidv1b32}.ip(f|n)s.*`
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6498
  - enables people to run subdomain gateways,
  removes dependency on Nginx hacks like [this one](https://github.com/ipfs/infra/issues/81#issuecomment-461045160)
  - unlocks unique Origins for localhost node and also [HTTP proxy](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2246)
- [Base32 in IPNS](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287) 
  - (we added `libp2p-key` multicodec to support CIDv1)
  - remaining steps:
   - IPNS paths: [wire up cid support instead of multihash](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287#issuecomment-498349216)
   - [how to handle CIDv1 with  `dag-pb` multicodec in `/ipns/`?](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5287#issuecomment-492163929)
- cloudflare and others do this (at ngnix level)
- if we have support for subdomain gateway, and we run go-ipfs on local host, it would in theory provide origin isolation on local gateway (don't want to support both on same origin)


### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- **PLEASE** help out on the forums, IRC, etc.
  - https://discuss.ipfs.io/
  - https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs
  - https://github.com/ipfs/specs
    - Specs maintainer protocol: https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/214
  - https://github.com/ipfs/notes
  - #ipfs, #ipfs-dev
- Comms on gateway and ongoing testing / leveling up
  - post about release process
  - still going to take time to make large changes to the gateway
  - testing infra is currently estimated to be the biggest blocker on this
  - there was a nearform effort that did something - needs some fixing up, alan can take a pass and demo
  - not large-scale testing, but is doing specific actions and tracking time across various actions
    - seems like it'd hit the first performance work: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xyqyGUF-oe3x9ln88YonVeOMWWdknik74lVgL_3dBY8/edit#gid=0
    - hooked up to grafana - want to also make public ideally
