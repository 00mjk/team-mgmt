### Notes

- Now you are going to be able to add a string, and have it appear as the file contents of the thing you just added!
  - Very cross-reaching changes to http client and interfaces
-  Steven will be reviewing the mount patches, and would like to land a bitswap improvement for better staying connected to peers bitswapping with
- Andrew demo'd a tool that allows people to verify that package releases are correct at the retro last week
- Mikeal has opened a pull request against Unixfsv1 spec to add metadata with time (creation, modification, etc) - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/220/files
  - biasing for action and progress here over perfect spec is the priority
  - access time will change every time viewed - maybe better to drop it?
  - metadata should be optional and off by default
  - flags for each custom attribute?
  - defaults will allow us to have backwards compatibility
  - most tools relying on checksum anyway
    - Let's bring this to a design review next week after core implementations now that we have a PR
