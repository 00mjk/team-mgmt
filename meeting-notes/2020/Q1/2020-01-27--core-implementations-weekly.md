## Notes

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs-http-client `42.0.0-pre.0` RELEASED üö¢
  - It smaller!
  - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/152863/73194114-92285900-4123-11ea-9903-f6ed12a57ab2.png" width="100%">
  
- js-ipfs `0.41` COMING SOON! üõ´
  - Highlights: async/await & UnixFS v1.5
  - Check out the API changes in the release issue:
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2656
  - Migration guide:
    - https://gist.github.com/alanshaw/04b2ddc35a6fff25c040c011ac6acf26
  - It faster!
  - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/152863/73194116-93f21c80-4123-11ea-9e75-0435c70f2513.png" width="100%" />
  - This is one run of the IPFS interop tests after (left) and before (right) the async/await refactor. These tests spin up 2 nodes and transfer one file between them of varying size.
  
- js-libp2p `0.27` COMING TOMORROW! üõ´
  - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/487

  - Review it here: https://github.com/ipfs/blog/pull/353

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@stebalien / @daviddias / @nonsense / @raulk

- 500 node DHT test working reliably.
  - 500-1000 nodes but the DHT test plan won't work with more than 500.
  - The remaining problems look like they may be related to the test but need more investigation.
- Work on testing multiple versions underway.
  - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/400
- Work on persisting assets under way
  - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/409

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun

- All high level (Epic / Feature set) issues have been created
- We will finish breaking down the work and estimating this week
  - We will be finalizing the timeline based on these
  - Issues will be created for each of the sub tasks if they don't already exist and associated to their parent issues.
- Content routing plan has seen many updates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obd3QHL5QLAUHqi8oxtOl0EYs9bAuPVwz5SWQ53rSvI/edit#
- Kademlia query logic PR has tests passing
  - We need to run this against Testground
- We have noticed spliting of the network (disjointed networks)  
  - Need to work out a plan on how to test and resolve this issue
  

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- go-ipfs: [subdomain gateway feature](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096) mostly implemented, remaining work: config cleanup, tests, docs and bugfixes
  - A version will be implemented for js-ipfs in the near future

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- Running test suites against bitswap master vs [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)
  - Spoiler: More seeds makes things speed up now!

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - Releasing tomorrow (v0.27), January 28th! üöÄ
  
- js-ipfs
  - async/await PRs merged

- Lets remove this initiative! \o/

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi

- Failed to get a preliminary version of the chunker-tester published/demoed today :( Ironing out the last few off-by-ones / mismatches with go-ipfs. *REALLY* should have it all done by tomorrow morning.
  - It's a cli tool that reads from stdin, the work hasn't been pushed yet. Will be pushed later today.

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Flushing out the js-libp2p roadmap for this year and will assess the priority of this against other initiatives. After initial discussion this still seems to be high on the priority list.

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- from @stebalien to @hsanjuan: will you likely have time to tackle this in the near future?
  - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6815

    - Discovered issues when using multiple bootstrappers
       - TCP simultaneous connect issue resolved
       - Very easy to cause disjoint networks with small k values (required for small number of simulated nodes to make sense)
    - Connection Manager trimming can cause disjointed networks...üò•
    - Can create static connection graphs during the test
- Blocked:
  - N/A

  - Test with larger networks on Kubernetes and modify the test plan to see if we can test the query logic on many nodes without dealing with connection manager issues
  - Update DHT plan to emit events and connection graphs on Kubernetes
  - Get discussions moving on Connection Manager trimming options and priority ordering
     - Change which connections we keep vs trim
     - Allow dissociating peer connection state from routing table state
