## Agenda

- Ensure a notetaker exists!
- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Initiatives
- Blockers (from the async status update)

  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

## Notes

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs 0.41 (https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2656)
  - Waiting on async/await refactor PRs (imminent)
- go-ipfs 0.4.23 still not out

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@stebalien / @daviddias / 

- Road to 1K+ nodes
  - We've found a network configuration for k8s that appears to work for us
  - We're almost done porting the sidecar to work on k8s (working through some final bugs).
- Remaining requirements for go-ipfs 0.5.0 have been defined. Mainly:
  - 1-10K nodes
  - Artificial latencies (e.g., 100ms).
  - Multiple IPFS/libp2p/DHT/etc. versions within a single test run (cross-version testing)
  - A way to extract traces/logs for debugging.


#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun ??

- Lots of design and research work during the ResNetLab research retreat
  - Many plans were creating for resolving outstanding issues
- Raul and Stebalien have been working on putting together a work plan for resolving outstanding issues

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- [Updated docs about gateways @ docs-beta.ipfs.io](https://docs-beta.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#http-gateways)
- Did not start subdomain work yet (finishing Q4 leftovers) 

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Should be kicking off again in the next couple weeks (once the async/await is live)

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

- Working on improving how updates are selected

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

- No updates (mostly)
- Started work on supporting badger 2.0

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- JS On hold
- Go has several PRs open for migrating to multihashes
  - The migration code to convert existing stores needs to be created

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Stebalien is still reviewing [proof of concept changes](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)
- js-bitswap implementation of [server side of PoC changes](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/204) (responds to want-have / want-block messages) is ready for review
  - AI @alanshaw to review

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs
  - Async/await PRs being rebased on top of UnixFS v1.5 work
  - Less than 10 files of tests to be refactored remaining

- js-libp2p
  - Working through final integration bugs with js-ipfs and libp2p interop
  - Will do an RC release once that is all passing and all examples/docs have been merged. (This should be in the next few days)

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- Merged `mode` and `mtime` support into js-ipfs
  - It will be released in the next version of js-ipfs

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements
@ribasushi

- Working on preliminary go-based implementation of hypothesis-tester. Update of progress at top of https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/227. Planning to close out entirety of O1 this week.

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- @alanshaw - would it be a good idea to write a separate blog post on UnixFS v1.5? What new things are landing in JS IPFS, why it's important etc. etc.
  - Yes! (@achingbrain will do it!)
- @dirkmc: which content routing improvements / fixes need to be made before 0.5 release?
  - We have a list we are currently editing, should hopefully share that out later this week. Query logic, correct / up to date / persisted routing tables, etc. Determining what's going to go into 0.5 and what will come after.
  - First step is getting adequate number of nodes (1k/10k) in testground, get metrics on the current version of the dht and replicate what we're seeing in production, so that when we perform these fixes we **know** it's better.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
